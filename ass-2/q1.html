          The queen of flowers, rose, is very beautiful and attractive. It grows in different colours like red, white, yellow, pink, and other varieties. Small thorns on the stem protect the plant. In the world of art, poetry, and literature, rose has been glorified as a symbol of love, compassion, and eternal beauty.
